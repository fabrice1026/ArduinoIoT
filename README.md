# ArduinoIoT
Experimental project, because I could not find a suitable existing solution

In short, the goal is to set-up the following system:

* Sensors
  * Electricity consumption (light pulse conting on the electricity meter)
  * Ambient temperature
* Commands
  * Command electrical heaters
  * 
* Comunication
  * Use GSM network
* Display
  * Asing Adafruit I2E LCD display with keypad
* Board
  * Arduino MKR GSM (at this stage)
* IoT platform
  * TBD
